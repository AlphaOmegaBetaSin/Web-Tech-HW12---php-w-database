					<b><u>About This Website:</u></b>
					<br/>
					<p>This webpage is basically my first ever AWS-curated webpage designed for me to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Web Design in general. Forgive the very amateurish feel of this website, as I am still <em>very new</em> to the front-end process of web development. Anyhow, feel free to browse through the different pages above, and have fun navigating through my website! Hopefully it\'ll look better as I get better and feel better to navigate as I feel better about coding in HTML.</p>
